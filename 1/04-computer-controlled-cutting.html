                  <p>
                              In our fablab we use Ronald JX25. The software connected to it is CutStudio. We need to Import our file into it. I imported my file in (jpg) form.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/machine.jpg" alt="machine" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              To start cutting with the help of Vinyl Cutter, you need to follow the steps given below:
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Open your image into the CutStudio</li>
                                 <li>Select the image and by right clicking on it give the image outline.</li>
                                 <li>Start the machine</li>
                                 <li>Set the force and origin</li>
                                 <li>Now click "cutting" in the software. By this command the machine will start cutting the material.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/tkd.jpg" alt="tkd" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              After the cutting is over then we need to gentally cut the material
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/cut.jpg" alt="cut" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                               Now for getting the better outline image we need to remove the outer layer first. Remove it gentally
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/RemoveOuterLayer.jpg" alt="RemoveOuterLayer" width="700" height="420" />
                              As the gum was not so sticky I removed the sketch directly from the paper and then stick it to my Laptop.
                              <br>

                              <h1>Laser cutting</h1>
                              Heter we have SIL Laser cutting machine. The software connected to it is RD Work. For importing any file this software we need to convert the file into (.dxf). The cutting, engraving and etching speed and power is possible to change. I am using a 1.9 mm thick MDF sheet. 
                              <br>
                              Follow the steps given below to start with laser cutting machine.
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Import your .dxf file into the software and set power and speed according to the material.</li>
                                 <li>The green sqaure dot on your sketch shows the origin.</li>
                                 <li>Select the file and click on Download</li>
                                 <li>Go to the machine and adjust the focus with the help of lens.</li>
                                 <li>Select the file and then set the origin of the laser extruder and select "Frame"</li>
                                 <li>Setting the frame will help you to know the area in which your sketch will get cut. Then you can start cutting.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <h3>Comb</h3>
                              <br>
                              It is difficult to know the pressfit dimentions of material of different thickness. So to overcome this a comb is made. In this kind of comb we are able to check different material of differen thicknes. Because of this trial and error time is saved. In laser cutting machine some of the material is burned so it is always a lesser dimention than the actual.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/comb.jpg" alt="comb" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <hr>
                              <br>
                              <br>



                              <h3>Pressfit</h3>
                              For a pressfit we had to make a Parametric design. I used Fusion 360 to make a parametric design. I am new to Designing so it was difficult for me to understand what is Parametric design. Gaurav explained me the method to set the parameters. After that I was a bit clear about the Parametric design. As I am using a 1.9 mm MDF sheet, I need to give a 1.7 mm for fitting in the material.
                              <br>
                              I wanted a make a square and slots on it's diagonal side. So first of all I started with making a square of 50 mm and made diagonals in it. Then i made the offset of lines in both direction. I had given 0.85 mm as distance between the slots of pressfit.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/StartingSquare.jpg" alt="StartingSquare" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/FinalRoughMarking.jpg" alt="FinalRoughMarking" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Now the width we get is 1.7 mm and mark the depth of the slot as 10 mm
                              <br>
                              I trimed the useless lines and finally got the figure as below.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/FinalFusionPressfit.jpg" alt="FinalFusionPressfit" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              The sketch is ready now, I have to give parameters. Go to (Modify << Change Parameters). This will open a window in which you can define the parameters you want to give.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/ParametersInFusion.jpg" alt="ParametersInFusion" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Give Parameters of Length and Height. I gave the parameters which I had drawn into the software.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/StartGivingParameters.jpg" alt="RemoveOuterLayer" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              After giving different paramters I got a totally different design which was not expected. I didn't give the parameters correctly and so the sketch got spoiled. 
                              <br><br>
                              <img src="images/week4/PressFailParameters.jpg" alt="PressFailParameters" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Finally I got the correct parameters after trying a lot and was able to change the size with correct dimentions
                              <br>

                              <br>



                              <h3>Diary Cover</h3>
                              I took the dimention of my Diary and made a same dimention box in Fusion.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/DiaryFusionBox.jpg" alt="DiaryFusionBox" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              The thickness of my Diary is 19 mm and the kerf I have given is about 30 mm. So the Kerfing to be made is in between 30 mm.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/StartingWithKerf.jpg" alt="StartingWithKerf" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Repeating the lines by Offset Command. But it could go only till 28mm.
                              <br>
                              For Kerf, the distance between two cuts must nearly be similar to the thickness of the material. So I have given 2 mm distance between the cuts. After cutting the sketch I came up with this.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <img src="images/week4/BookCoverOpen.jpg" alt="BookCoverOpen" width="700" height="420" />
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Now I kept my Diary into the cover it fitted well as the dimentions I kept were quite large. The final sketch for this is as shown below
                              <br>
